        - animation

                - 2d vs 3d
                2D (‘frame by frame’) is very time consuming and methodical, but I would say you progress at a ‘steady pace’. The level of difficulty too will depend on your drawing skills- if you can draw quickly and ‘efficiently’ (getting the form right immediately) you will find it easier.

                3D is quicker in the sense that you don’t have to animate ‘every’ frame, as you set the beginning and ending position of your animated components, and the software will do the frames in-between (‘tweening’). In this way, you can animate in 3D far quicker than 2D.

                However, 3D is very technical and you have lots of other elements to consider outside of just animating: modeling, rigging, lighting, rendering, cameras, etc. And all of these things can break or run into issues…

                draw 2d > 3d = more dynamic
                3d > draw 2d = looks rigid
